# Input data for the SleepML pipeline

## Preloom data repository

These files are stored using the h5ad format, which is very easy to load into an AnnData object in Python using `anndata.read_h5ad(file.h5ad)`.

The files were generated by Kris Davis and are a copy of the originals found at `/staging/leuven/stg_00003/cbd-bioinf/CBD__SHLI__Joana_Dopp__Sleep_Signature/NovaSeq6000_20201130/20201214/Preloom/`

You can download the All_Combined_No_ZT2_Wake.h5ad dataset like this:

```
scp  r23i27n14:/staging/leuven/stg_00003/cbd-bioinf/CBD__SHLI__Joana_Dopp__Sleep_Signature/NovaSeq6000_20201130/20201214/Preloom/All_Combined_No_ZT2_Wake.h5ad .
```


## Backgrounds

A background is a collection of cell_types i.e. clusters of cells that share some similarity
These backgrounds are listed in `backgrounds/`. For each background, severall cell types are listed, as well as the louvain resolution at which they are defined in All_Combined_No_ZT2_Wake.h5ad and the index they have under that resolution

```
cluster,louvain_res,idx
ab,louvain_res2.0,4
```

## Markers

A marker gene of a cell type is a gene whose expression is signficantly different on that cell type when compared to the rest of the brain or other cell types.

The `markers/` folder contains one file per cell type. In each cell type we have a list of marker genes as well as their log2FC and the significance.
